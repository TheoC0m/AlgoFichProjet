A simple Java file indexer tool

This is a school project.
It is a simple tool allowing to index files by name, size or type.
The specified folder is recursively explored, then, an index file is created on its root.
Once indexed, user can perform comparison between to index files : the tool shows the diff.
User can also search for a file, if the file exists, the tool returns it's path.

It uses Singleton and Factory design patterns.
